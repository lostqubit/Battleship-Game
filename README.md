# Battleship-Game

A web-based implementation of the classic strategy board game "Battleship" where players can arrange their ships on a grid and take turns guessing the locations of the opponent's ships, the first player to sink all the opponent ships wins the game! The UI is implemented with HTML and CSS and the core game logic is implemented with vanilla JavaScript, handling user interactions such as turn-based mechanics, ship placement validation and win/loss conditions. Drag and drop feature for ship placement is implemented using jQuery UI. jQuery UI Touch Punch is used to extend drag and drop support for mobile devices.
